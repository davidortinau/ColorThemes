## üé® What is this?

The .NET MAUI Color Themes Generator is a powerful, yet simple tool that helps developers create harmonious color palettes for their .NET MAUI applications. By entering just four colors (primary, secondary, light background, and dark background), it automatically generates a complete theme including:

- Primary and Secondary colors
- Surface variations (Surface0-3)
- Feedback colors (Error, Success, Info)
- Background and foreground colors
- Active and disabled states
- Light and dark theme variants optimized for accessibility

## ‚ú® Features

- **Customizable Color Inputs**: Enter hex color codes for primary, secondary, light and dark backgrounds
- **Instant Theme Generation**: Create complete color themes from your four base colors
- **Live Preview**: See your theme applied to common MAUI controls in real-time
- **Dark Mode Support**: Customize and preview both light and dark mode variations
- **Multiple Code Formats**: Generate code in various formats:
  - AppThemeColor (XAML)
  - AppThemeBinding with StaticResources (XAML) 
  - Color with DynamicResources (XAML)
  - MauiReactor (C#)
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android
